US Chronic Disease Analysis & Cardiovascular Disease Prediction using Machine Learning



This project analyzes the U.S. Chronic Disease Dataset to uncover health trends and predict cardiovascular disease prevalence across states. It combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning modeling, and interactive dashboards to deliver actionable public health insights.

🔍 Key Features

Data Preprocessing & EDA:

Cleaned missing values, filtered relevant columns, and removed duplicates

Generated state-wise and disease-wise data visualizations to identify major health patterns

Disease Focus – Cardiovascular Health:

Identified cardiovascular disease as the most prevalent condition

Used this as the prediction target for model building

Machine Learning Models:

Trained and evaluated Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models

Selected XGBoost for deployment with top metrics:

RMSE: 1677.98

R²: 0.997

Interactive Dashboards:

Four dashboards built to visualize trends across states, genders, and age groups

Filters available by disease, state, age, and gender

Provides insights into disease distribution and trends over time

Deployment:

Model and dashboards deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for scalability and accessibility

⚙️ Tech Stack

Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost

Visualization: Plotly, Dash / Streamlit

Deployment: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

🎯 Outcome

Accurately predicts the number of cardiovascular disease cases per U.S. state and reveals valuable insights into the evolving public health landscape supporting data-driven decision-making in healthcare analytics.
